# MarilynMansonArt
Art Style Transfer using VGG

    Here the the neural net learns by minimizing the loss between two images, one that is of a face drawn by the greatest artist of all time, Marilyn Manson, and a similar portrait.  
    First the images are sqaured with same dimensions for ease of manipulation, then fed into the VGG model without the fully conneded layers since this is not classification.  
    Attached is the Jupyter Notebook in HTML
